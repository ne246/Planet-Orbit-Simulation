gravity is relative to different objects 

all objects are attract to one another, and exert force on each other 
force they have on one another is based on the mass of the objects (this really matters for heavy objects, like earth)

Earth is super heavy so thats why it exerts a massive force on us that pulls us down towrds the earth 
what determines this force is the distance between you and earth center, thats why if your in space its 0 gravity because you are further away from earth


GRAVITIONAL FORCE:  
F = GMm/r^2

F = force of gravity
G = gravitational constant (6.67 x 10^-11)
M = mass of one objects
m = mass of other objects
r = distance between the two objects (expotential because, further you go the less gravity you'll have vice versa)


In the sense of this, planets are mutiple masses moving around each other 


Earth to Sun Logic: Earth ----> is moving in a x direction (some speed ->)
                      |
                      |  force(Gravitional Force) pulling towards the Sun: THIS MAKEs IT CURVE
                      v
                     Sun


Earth all ready has momentum that move in another direction (X direction)

Other planets attract each other effecting its orbtiral trajectory.
so that means we need to calculate force of the sun to a planet and the force to a planet to planet

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Caluculating the orbital trajectory:

step 1: Find r and use it find F

                    Earth           we want to move this in to x direction and y direction
                      /            
               F    /  |
                  /    | y
                /      |
              /________|
            Sun    x

step 2:

                    Earth          Find distance r 
                      /            x = (x,y)
               r    /  |           y = (x1, y1)
                  /    | y         r = root(x^2 + y^2)
                /      |        
              /________|
            Sun    x

step 3:

                    Earth          Use r to find F
                      /            F = GMm/r^2
               F    /  |           
                  /    | y        
                /      |
              /________|
            Sun    x

step 3: Find the oppisite direction from the force back to x and y componenets
                                   
                     Earth          Find theatha to find Fy and Fx = arc(tangent) or tan^-1(y/x)
                      /  |          tan(theatha) = y/x (o/a)       tan^-1(y/x) = thetha
               F    /    |          
                  /      | Fy       Then,
                /        |          SOH CAH TOA
              /__theatha_|          sin(theatha) = o/h = Fy/F  -> F * sin(theatha) = Fy
            Sun    Fx               cos(theatha) = o/h = Fx/F  -> F * cos(theatha) = Fx
